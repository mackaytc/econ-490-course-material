Links for the slides and course content from this week's lecture: 

- [ECON 490 Metrics Slides - Regression Review Pt 2](https://github.com/mackaytc/econ-490-course-material/blob/main/week-3/ECON%20490%20Metrics%20Slides%20-%20Regression%20Review%20Pt%202%20(PDF).pdf)
  - Covers metrics material for the week including using our Venn Diagram model to visualize controlling for a variable and a discussion of factor variables and including them in regressions. 
  - For this week, I've pulled material across several chapters of *The Effect*.
    - Part of the lecture material draws on Chapter 4, which we started covering last week [(link here)](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-DescribingRelationships.html).
    - The lecture material also picks up several sections from [Chapter 13](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-StatisticalAdjustment.html) - note that some of the discussion in this chapter is more advanced than what we've covered thus far (so you can skip if it for now!).
