Links for the slides and course content from this week's lecture: 

- [ECON 490 Metrics Slides - Regression Review Pt 2](https://github.com/mackaytc/econ-490-course-material/blob/main/week-3/ECON%20490%20Metrics%20Slides%20-%20Regression%20Review%20Pt%202%20(PDF).pdf)
  - Covers metrics material for the week including using our Venn Diagram model to visualize controlling for a variable and a discussion of factor variables and including them in regressions. 
  - For this week, I've pulled material across several chapters of *The Effect*.
    - Part of the lecture material draws on Chapter 4, which we started covering last week [(link here)](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-DescribingRelationships.html).
    - The lecture material also picks up several sections from [Chapter 13](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-StatisticalAdjustment.html) - note that some of the discussion in this chapter is more advanced than what we've covered thus far (so you can skip it for now!).
- [ECON 490 Slides - Introduction to Economic Research (PDF)](https://github.com/mackaytc/econ-490-course-material/blob/main/week-3/ECON%20490%20Slides%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Economic%20Research%20(PDF).pdf)
  - In these slides, we'll introduce economics research, talk about several examples of economic research, and define three broad categories of research. 
  - One place to find current economics research is the NBER working paper series here: [Working Papers | NBER](https://www.nber.org/papers?page=1&perPage=50&sortBy=public_date)
    - NBER regularly releases working papers highlighting cutting-edge research in economics. You can sign up to receive a weekly email with papers from them. 
  - If you're interested, you can read about the research I've done here: [Research â€“ Taylor Mackay](https://tmackay.io/research/)
- [The Effect of Criminal Records on Access to Employment (Agan and Starr 2017)](https://github.com/mackaytc/econ-490-course-material/blob/main/week-3/The%20Effect%20of%20Criminal%20Records%20on%20Access%20to%20Employment%20(Agan%20and%20Starr%202017).pdf)
  - You should read the (very short!) journal article above before next week's class and be prepared to answer a basic question or two about the topic as part of the weekly metrics quiz.  
- [ECON 490 Coding Activity 3](https://github.com/mackaytc/econ-490-course-material/blob/main/week-3/ECON%20490%20Coding%20Activity%203.R)
  - Our third coding activity using R. Make sure to install and load the `tidyverse` package in R before starting the activity if you have not done so already.
